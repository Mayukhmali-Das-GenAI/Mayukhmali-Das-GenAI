# Mayukhmali Das - Generative AI Data Scientist

Greetings, I am Mayukhmali Das, a dedicated data scientist with a profound focus on Generative AI, presently contributing my expertise at IDFC FIRST Bank. My journey includes enriching experiences as a Data Science Intern at CMU and Jadavpur University, where I cultivated a passion for harnessing advanced technologies to tackle practical challenges and foster innovation.

## Experience

### IDFC FIRST Bank
- **Generative AI**
  - *Feb 2024 - Present*
  - Leading all audio transcription (STT) and language identification initiatives, including experimentation and deployment.
  - Contributing to fine-tuning initiatives for LLMs and STTs.
  - Expanding generative AI use cases based on audio at the Bank.

I am actively engaged in leveraging cutting-edge tools such as OpenAI Whisper, Nvidia Parakeet, AWS Transcribe, Azure Transcription Services,  GPT 4, GPT4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and other state-of-the-art GEN AI technologies.

- **Education Loan & Hyperpersonalization Engine(HPE)**
  - *Jul 2023 - Jan 2024*
  - I developed the core deep learning and machine learning models for the Education Loan division at IDFC:
  - Various Propensity Models to acquire new Education Loan customers, trained on data from 30 million customers. Each customer profile includes ten thousand unique features, which we refer to as Customer DNA.
  - Classification Models that predict whether a prospective customer is likely to choose an International or Domestic Education Loan.
  - Hyper-personalized communication channels for Education Loan based on factors such as customer locality and other elements from the Customer DNA.

### Undergraduate Research Journey Summary
  - Engaged in AI research from 2020, explored diverse domains: Monocular Depth Estimation, Multilingual Sentiment Analysis, Spiking Neural Networks, Event-based Vision, and Graph Neural Networks.
  - Published papers on depth estimation, event-based data clustering, and sensor data recovery using Graph Neural Networks.
  - Explored Brain Computer Interface applications, culminating in projects on efficient Electromagnet placement for trans-cranial surgery.
  - Demonstrated adaptability across computer vision, NLP, neuromorphic architectures and optimization.
